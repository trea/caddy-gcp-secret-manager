## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have identified a security issue in the project, please do not create a public issue. Instead, report any potential vulnerabilities on the security page of the repository. You may also email the maintainer of this repository directly at trea@treahauet.com.

You will receive acknowledgement of the report right away. I will commit to triaging and remediating the issue as soon as possible.

Once any discovered vulnerabilities are repaired, you will be publicly credited for the discovery.
